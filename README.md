# Human Emotion Predictor

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning pipeline using MobileNetV2 for image classification and deploy it in a minimalistic web app. The frontend allows users to upload an image, and the backend predicts the class using a pretrained model.

## Project Overview
This project is a deep learning-based image classification web app.

**Background Image**: Designed using Canva.

**Backend**: Built with Python using the Keras deep learning library.

**Model**: Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 for image classification.

**Frontend**: Built using HTML and JavaScript for interactive UI.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used for training the image classification model was sourced from Kaggle:

This dataset contains labeled images across multiple classes and was used to train the MobileNetV2 model via transfer learning. Preprocessing steps included resizing images to 128x128 and normalizing pixel values for compatibility with the model.
